# ABAP LLM Client Downport

This is an automated donwport of [ABAP LLM Client](https://github.com/abap-ai/llm_client). This is a best effort donwport using the awesome downport features of [abaplint](abaplint.ord). Unfortunately I have no system with a release below 7.50 available, therefore bugs and syntax issues are expected. While the syntax downport target is 7.02 I do expect major issues with everything below 7.40.

If you face issues feel free to open an issue.

Mandatory: Ensure you have at least PL12 of /UI2/CL_JSON see SAP Note 2798102.
