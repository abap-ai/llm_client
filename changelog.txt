----------------

- Rework of the client interface, old one available as zif_llm_client_int
- New ZCL_LLM_CLIENT is a wrapper around the old (now internal) interface, prefer this
- Several bugfixes especially for Gemini client and tool calls
- Features of the new client:
    - Simplified interface
    - Request now handled internally, one interface only
    - Send User Message with execute --> no add_message required
    - Auto-add LLM responses to chat history
    - Auto-retry in case of error (3 times by default, additional 10 seconds wait on 429/529)
    - Simpler execution of tools
